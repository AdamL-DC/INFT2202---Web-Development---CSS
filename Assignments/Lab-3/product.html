                <b>Neon Genesis Evangelion</b><br>
                I feel like there's no good way for me to discuss my favorite pieces of media without,
                what I consider to be one of the best media series ever released, Neon Genesis Evangelion. <br>
                The only real way to accurately describe evangelion is "Giant robots fighting biblical monsters while some 
                kid cries the whole time"<br>
                despite the comedic desciption that the show can be cut down to it truly shows some of the deepest and most
                complex character writing that I've ever seen in media<br>
                (I watch tons of different forms of media I swear it's a mostly unbiased opinion)<br>
                While I will be the first one to admit that the series has become somewhat of a mess with the 5(?) different
                movies that released after the original show.<br>
                A short summary of the actual important portions of the series:<br>
                - The earth has been attacked by "Angels"(giant monsters but the name is important) causing near mass
                extinction of the human race and dissapeared<br>
                - 15 years after dissapearing the angels return and begin attacking humanity again<br>
                - Shinji is a 13 year old in a futuristic version of earth and his father runs nerv - the anti-angel
                protection division<br>
                - Shinji is one of 4+ (it's 4 1/2 in the original{half is a whole lore thing} but more in the movies) teens
                who can pilot an evangelion unit(giant robot to fight monsters)<br>
                <br>
                Evangelion started as a manga series in 1994 in the Shonen Ace magazine. The series quickly blew up and was
                turned into an animated t.v. show in 1995.<br>
                Once the show was finished a movie was released called end of evangelion that provided an alternate to 
                the last 2 episodes of the original show<br>
                In 2007 the series would return for a final movie series (rebuild) of 4 movies that provided an alternate and
                more "canon"/finalized ending to the series<br>
                I could honestly write pages more about this series but I'll leave it there (please watch it it's really good)

                I was laughing my a** off almost the entire time and when I wasn't my mouth was wide open from pure shock at what was going on. <br>
                This movie is able to perfectly combine action and comedy, giving off a pretty similar vibe to movies like the kingsmen but feeling <br>
                not having the over the top goofy stuff that the kingsmen included. This is also the first movie I feel has done the "story time" <br>
                method of story telling (idk if thats what its actually called but its when the whole movie is flashbacks and stuff) mainly because <br>
                rather than everything being narrated over and having it from a single persons perspective they actually just show it like a normal <br>
                movie and use the flashback aspect to just show other viewpoints of what's going on and lets them still actually have twists without <br>
                having everything spoiled by seeing the present after the events. I also really like how rather than constantly having a ton of <br>
                completely unrealistic fist fighting they actually use guns like real people would. I genuinely think that this is easily my new <br>
                favorite movies and I could go on for so much longer about it but I'd rather people reading this just actually watch the movie genuinely 
                <br>
                <b>9.5/10</b>
                <br>
                <b>Technical viewpoint</b>
                This movie genuinely looks amazing, none of the gore is overplayed and it seems relatively realistic, <br>
                the camera work is really good especially for an action movie that normally has super jumpy cuts constantly <br>
                where as this movie felt like it stuck to 1 jump cut a scene (it might have been a lot more I'll likely rewatch <br>
                it soon and update if I realize differently(on rewatches(multiple)), can confirm it holds up). <br>
                My only issue is the little bit they do use effects the green screen is really bad, <br>
                to be fair I feel like a lot of greenscreen in movies isn't done very well especially when its a "realistic" movie <br>
                and they green screen them driving cars, I understand it can be rally hard to do practically but that one moment <br>
                kind of ripped me out of the movie for a minute (pulled me right back in though dw). A large detail this movie did <br>
                well is that the characters actually acted like people, there was no "epic one liners" or excessive melee combat, if <br>
                real people in those positions would use guns, they just use guns. It causes the movie to feel more realistic and grounds <br>
                the movie a little bit more. Which then brings me to the acting, and holy s*** was it good. I really liked Matthew McConaughey <br>
                in the wolf of wall street and I feel like hes really good at playing the typical bigger than life (idk if im using that term <br>
                correctly) characters, ie. charming ceo, super rich classy drug dealer, etc. and he fits the role of Michael perfectly, also while <br>
                writing this I just now realized that the guy who plays Raymond was the main character in pacific rim which I absolutely loved <br>
                as a kid. But overall this move is amazing and does almost everything perfectly <br>

                Owen and Annie who both struggle with mental illness participate in a pharmaceutical trial which is attempting to combine <br>
                the use of drugs and AI to create a cure all for any mental issues someone struggles with<br>
                <br>
                <b>My Opinion</b>
                <br>
                First off I have to say this is one of my favorite types of media, the idea of retrofuturism but rather than being similar <br>
                to the Jetsons it combines late 90s/early 2000s with technology we're on the verge of creating/in the beginning steps of creating. <br>
                I really enjoy the aspects of visually showing a characters schizophrenia (not a spoiler its literally in the opening scene) by <br>
                having a character that's both in the reality the show but also has an alter version of themselves which I find shows the <br>
                confusion that the main character has involving his own grip on reality. I'll be honest, trying to write this without spoiling <br>
                the show is really difficult so I'll likely keep this section short. Seeing Johna hill playing a serious roll especially someone <br>
                who struggles so much was really refreshing since a majority of his career has been more comedic roles (super bad, 21 jump street, <br>
                etc.) I find there were still some pretty dumb plot points but at least they managed to incorporate them into the show well enough <br>
                to cover up the fact that its dumb. <br>
                <b>8.5/10</b>
                <br>
                <b>Technical Viewpoint</b>
                <br>
                This show was really visually stunning, it reminded me a lot of the dark scenery complemented with bright neon lights of <br>
                Enter The Void (I know I've mentioned it a lot but I will eventually review it). I loved the major difference between the bland <br>
                outside world and the vibrant flashy clean inside of the trial showed (at least in my opinion) how the characters tend to live boring <br>
                and repetitive lives but once they enter the trial everything is flipped on their heads and become actually interesting. Yet again I <br>
                have to mention the stupidity behind some of the beginning points in the plot but the fact they incorporated them into a catalyst for <br>
                the well thought out aspects of the plot is really impressive. The main aspect of the plot being the trials showed just how well <br>
                thought out the show was overall, having each trial be its own separate story but still managing to further the connection between <br>
                Annie and Owen kept the show feeling interesting the entire way through. <br>
