            <h3>Game Programmer</h3>
            <p>
                I have previously worked on multiple unity games and projects, and have recently learned godot.<br>
                I have experience working in both 2d and 3d environments within both unity and godot and have messed around with the <br>
                basics of other game engines such as unreal engine<br>
                <br>
                Within the scope of my game development projects I have also learned how to work with a multitude of <br>
                accompanying software such as blender, most mainstream Adobe software(photoshop, premiere pro and countless alternatives), etc.

            <h3>Application Programmer</h3>
            <p>
                Seeing as I am a current student at Durham College in the computer programming and analysis program I have had my fair share of application development<br>
                During my time as a Durham College student I have worked with a variety of languages to create a variety of application types<br>
                <br>
                During my first semester I learned and worked in python and sql<br>
                During my second semester I learned html, css and java<br>
                During my third semester I learned C# and fully setup java and sql interactions<br>
                And During my fourth semester(current) I am further working with java, sql, html, css, C# and I'm currently learning javascript<br>
            </p>

            <h3>Database Developer</h3>
            <p>
                Database development is something that I began learning in my first semester and have continued to refine with my constant use of it within my current program<br>
                I began with simply learning sql and how to interact with databases however during my second and third semesters I continued to refine my skills<br>
                in overall interactions with databases however I have found that I am not only fond of database development but I was actually fairly good at it.<br>
                <br>
                This has lead me to continuing to refine my skills within the scope of database interactions and actually implementing<br>
                similar systems to those designed in my courses for some personal game development projects for functions such as inventories<br>
